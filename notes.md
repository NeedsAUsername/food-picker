The Plan:

1) User inputs for choosing what kind of food they want(lunch/dinner/cuisine/price/ratings, etc.)
2) Fetch yelp api to display restaurants in their area (zip code input) according to above.
3) Have a page that chooses a random restaurant near them.
4) Have a history page with the restaurants they've chosen. Allow like/dislike/link to yelp page.
